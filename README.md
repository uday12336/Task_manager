Project Overview:

In this project, I built the entire frontend using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no frameworks or libraries. This hands-on approach deepened my understanding of core web technologies and allowed me to explore advanced JavaScript concepts, such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous programming. I particularly enjoyed diving into powerful JavaScript features like closures, prototypes, and modern ES6+ syntax.
One of the highlights was crafting a fully responsive design that adapts seamlessly across devices, from desktops to mobiles. This not only honed my skills in CSS Flexbox and Grid but also emphasized the importance of user-centric, accessible web experiences.

The project is deployed and ready for anyone to explore! Check it out here: Live Link.
Feel free to clone the repo, tinker with the code, or reach out with feedback—I'm always open to discussions on frontend best practices!
